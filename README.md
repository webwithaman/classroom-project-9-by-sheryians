## Classroom Project 9 by Sheryians Coding School

This is a simple Instagram-inspired static project where posts are generated dynamically using JavaScript from an array of objects. It features a like button with heart animation, and users can also double-click on a post to like it. The navbar smartly hides on scroll down and shows up when scrolling up. A custom cursor follows the mouse movement to enhance the user interaction. The project focuses on DOM manipulation and handling events like click, dblclick, and mousemove.
